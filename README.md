## About
This is the codebase used in the development of a Human Tracking Fan! We used a number of different tools, frameworks, programming languages and hardware knowledge to complete this project!

## Languages/Frameworks/Tools

### Python
Some libraries used:
* Flask
* OpenCV
* Tensorflow
* Numpy


### JavaScript
You may need to enable JavaScript in your web browser to run the desktop app! We used Fetch APIs for communicating between Flask and JavaScript.



### Arduino (C++)
You don't need to worry about this if you aren't developing a new feature!



## Instructions

1 - To run our full program, please cd to the web-app folder </br>
2 - Connect the fully wired project hardware </br>
3 - There you can change the serialOn variable in the python file to True (if False, allows for usage without serial connection!) </br>
4 - In ./web-app, type 'flask run' in the command line </br>
5 - Access the web-app by typing '127.0.0.1:5000' in your web browser window </br>
